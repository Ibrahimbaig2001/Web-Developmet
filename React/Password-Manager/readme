This is a password-manager project created using React+Vite+TailwindCSS. The motivation behind this project is to store the passwords of accounts such as github, leetcode, hackerrank and other non financial accounts so that one can 
be free from remembering vast number of passwords, and avoid confusion as google has inbuit password saver but when you update it the password some time may not be saved. So to avoid this condition you can update the password in the manager and save it and can use it for the future.
Functionalities of this project includes saving the password, copying different fields or strings from the saved password such as the url, username and the password. You have the access to either delete the password or edit the saved password, which is done when you confirm the changes that are being made.
This implementation using mongobd, express will be uploaded to represent that the storage can me made on a db and crud operations can be performed through it.
